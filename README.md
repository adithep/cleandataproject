Getting and Cleaning Data
=========================

Steps to get the tidy data.
---------------------------

1. Make sure you have installed all the dependencies: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `margrittr`.
2. Make sure your working directory is the root directory of the project.
3. Run the script `run_analysis.r`.
4. The script will create a function on your global environment called `run_analysis`.
5. Call the function `run_analysis` and save result to any variable you desire example: `tidy_dt <- run_analysis()`
